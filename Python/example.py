This script implements a multilateration algorithm that, given the coordinates of a finite number of radio stations,
and given their distances to the station (derived from the intensities of the signal they received in a previous step)
computes the most probable coordinates of the station. Even if the distances computed for each station do not match
(in terms of pointing to a single optimal solution) the algorithm finds the coordinates that minimize the error function
and returns the most optimal solution possible.

The task: Given the implementation below in Python 3.6, replicate this sample script in C++, implementing the
optimization algorithm that lies at the core of this script (The Nelder-Mead simplex algorithm) from scratch.
